# Spotify Music Player Clone

This project is a web-based music player inspired by Spotify, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a sleek and functional interface for users to interact with and enjoy a collection of pre-defined songs. The application includes essential features such as music playback controls, a song list, and a progress bar for tracking and seeking within the current song.

The **index.html** file serves as the backbone of the application, defining the overall structure and layout. The **style.css** file handles the visual appearance, incorporating modern design principles, responsive layouts, and custom fonts such as *Ubuntu* and *Varela Round* sourced from Google Fonts. For functionality, the **script.js** file implements the logic for song playback, user interactions, and navigation between songs.

The music player has been designed with user experience in mind. Users can play or pause songs, navigate through the list, and even track their progress using a dynamic progress bar. The interface adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

To use the project, clone the repository from GitHub and open the `index.html` file in your browser. The application is lightweight and runs entirely in the browser without requiring any external dependencies. This project is an excellent starting point for learning the basics of front-end development and exploring web-based multimedia applications.

Future improvements could include adding features such as playlist creation, shuffle, and repeat modes, as well as integrating a real music streaming API for a dynamic song library. Enhancing the user interface with animations and transitions would further refine the overall experience.
